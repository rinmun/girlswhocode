        <p class= "paragraph"> Nagivating through one's teenage years has always been difficult, and in today's world of rising expectations and standards some may say it is even impossible. Not all high school students are fortunate enough to have someone willing or capable of giving them the guidance and support necessary to push them to reach their fullest potential as well as steer them in the right path. MentorMe was created to help these teens by creating connections to help them succeed as well-rounded students and individuals

          <p> Hello, my name is Rina and I'm a highschool senior from the Bay Area. I've just begun coding this summer and I hope to improve my quickly improve my skills! I created MentorMe because throughout highschool, I always wished there was an easy way to get guidance from a mentor, especially because I didn't have the connections or resources to get one </p> <br>
